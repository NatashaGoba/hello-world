# hello-world
This is my  get to know GitHub practice Repo

This is like a "tell me about yourself" interview question.
I don't think ive ever known how to answer these, anyway before i digress any further; allow me to introduce myself:

Greetings
My name is Natasha 
My greatest stregnth is my ability to perservere . This is my biggest pride.
secondly its my ability to quickly learn new concepts and retain information.
Im a big fan of Anime and enjoy reading horror stories,true crime stories an well as cook books :D (hahahaha , i bet you were expecting something different on the last part )
Anywho , I think ill leave this right here, as is. i hope you enjoy scraping the surface of who i am . 

Have a lovely day further.
Stay kind
